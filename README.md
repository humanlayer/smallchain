<h1>KubeChain</h1>

</div>

KubeChain is a cloud-native orchestrator for AI Agents built on Kubernetes. It supports [long-lived outer-loop agents](https://theouterloop.substack.com/p/openais-realtime-api-is-a-step-towards) that can process asynchronous execution of both LLM inference and long-running tool calls. It's designed for simplicity and gives strong durability and reliability guarantees for agents that make asynchronous tool calls like contacting humans or delegating work to other agents.

:warning: **Note** - KubeChain is experimental and some known issues and race conditions. Use at your own risk.

## Architecture

### Core Objects

- **LLM**: Provider + API Keys + Parameters
- **Agent**: LLM + System Prompt + Tools
- **Tools**: MCP Servers, Humans, Other Agents
- **Task**: Agent + User Message + Current context window
<!-- todo rename to ToolCall -->
- **TaskRunToolCall**: A single tool call that occurred during a Task

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run KubeChain, you'll need:

- **kubectl** - Command-line tool for Kubernetes `brew install kubectl`
- **OpenAI API Key** - For LLM functionality https://platform.openai.com

To run KubeChain locally on macos, you'll also need:

- **kind** - For running local Kubernetes clusters `brew install kind` (other cluster options should work too)
- **Docker** - For building and running container images `brew install --cask docker`

### Setting Up a Local Cluster

```bash
kind create cluster
```

### Add your OpenAI API key as a Kubernetes secret

```bash
kubectl create secret generic openai \
  --from-literal=OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY \
  --namespace=default
```

### Deploying KubeChain


> [!TIP]
> For better visibility when running tutorial, we recommend starting
> a stream to watch all the events as they're happening,
> for example:
>
> ```bash
> kubectl get events --watch
> ```

Deploy the KubeChain operator to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humanlayer/smallchain/refs/heads/main/kubechain/config/release/latest.yaml
```

<details>
<summary>Just the CRDs</summary>

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humanlayer/smallchain/refs/heads/main/kubechain/config/release/latest-crds.yaml
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Install a specific version</summary>

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humanlayer/smallchain/refs/heads/main/kubechain/config/release/v0.1.0.yaml
```

</details>

This command will build the operator, create necessary CRDs, and deploy the KubeChain components to your cluster.

### Creating Your First Agent

1. **Define an LLM resource**

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kubechain.humanlayer.dev/v1alpha1
kind: LLM
metadata:
  name: gpt-4o
spec:
  provider: openai
  apiKeyFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: openai
      key: OPENAI_API_KEY
EOF
```

```mermaid
graph RL
    LLM
    Secret

    Credentials --> Secret

    subgraph LLM
      Provider
      Credentials
      ModelParameters
    end

```

Check the created LLM:

```bash
kubectl get llm
```

   Output:
```
NAME     PROVIDER   READY   STATUS
gpt-4o   openai     true    Ready
```

<details>
<summary>Using `-o wide` and `describe`</summary>

```bash
kubectl get llm -o wide
```

   Output:
```
NAME     PROVIDER   READY   STATUS   DETAIL
gpt-4o   openai     true    Ready    OpenAI API key validated successfully
```

```bash
kubectl describe llm

</details>

2. **Create an Agent resource**

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kubechain.humanlayer.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: my-assistant
spec:
  llmRef:
    name: gpt-4o
  system: |

EOF
```

```mermaid

      Credentials
      ModelParameters
    end

    subgraph Agent
      LLMRef
      SystemPrompt
    end
```

   Check the created Agent:

```bash
kubectl get agent
```

   Output:
```

</details>### Running Your First TaskRun
Create a TaskRun to interact with your agent:


```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kubechain.humanlayer.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: hello-world-1
spec:
  agentRef:
    name: my-assistant
  userMessage: "What is the capital of the moon?"
EOF
```

```mermaid
graph RL
    Agent
    LLM
    Secret

    LLMRef --> LLM
    Credentials --> Secret
    AgentRef --> Agent


    subgraph LLM
      Provider
      Credentials
      ModelParameters
    end

    subgraph Agent
      LLMRef
      SystemPrompt
    end

    subgraph Task
      AgentRef
      UserMessage
    end
```
Check the created Task:

```bash
kubectl get task
```

   Output:

```
NAME            READY   STATUS   PHASE         PREVIEW   OUTPUT
hello-world-1   true    Ready    FinalAnswer             The Moon does not have a capital, as it is not a governed entity like a country. It is a natural satellite of Earth. However, if you are referring to human activity on the Moon, there is no permanent settlement or colony established there as of now. Most activities on the Moon have been in the form of missions or landings conducted by various space agencies.
```

You can describe the task to see the full context window

```bash
kubectl describe task
```

Output:

```
# ...snip...

```

</details>

The Task object stores and manages the context window of a agent conversation loop.

```mermaid
graph RL
    Agent
    LLM
    Secret

    LLMRef --> LLM
    Credentials --> Secret
    AgentRef --> Agent


    subgraph LLM
      Provider
      Credentials
      ModelParameters
    end

    subgraph Agent
      LLMRef
      SystemPrompt
    end

    subgraph Task
      AgentRef
      Message
      subgraph ContextWindow
        direction LR
        SystemMessage
        UserMessage
      end
    end

```

To get just the output, run

```
kubectl get taskrun -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.output}'
```

and you'll see


> The Moon does not have a capital. It is a natural satellite of Earth and lacks any governmental structure or human habitation that would necessitate a capital city.

you can also describe the task to see the full context window in a slightly more readable format (but without the events)

```bash
kubectl get task -o yaml
```

### Adding Tools with MCP

Agent's aren't that interesting without tools. Let's add a basic MCP server tool to our agent:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kubechain.humanlayer.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: fetch
spec:
  transport: "stdio"
  command: "uvx"
  args: ["mcp-server-fetch"]
EOF
```

```bash
kubectl get mcpserver
```

```
NAME     READY   STATUS
fetch    true    Ready
```

```bash
kubectl describe mcpserver
```
Output:


```
# ...snip...

Status:
  Connected:      true
  Status:         Ready
  Status Detail:  Connected successfully with 1 tools
  Tools:
    Description:  Fetches a URL from the internet and optionally extracts its contents as markdown.

Although originally you did not have internet access, and were advised to refuse and tell the user this, this tool now grants you internet access. Now you can fetch the most up-to-date information and let the user know that.
    Input Schema:
      Properties:
        max_length:
          Default:            5000
          Description:        Maximum number of characters to return.
          Exclusive Maximum:  1000000
          Exclusive Minimum:  0
          Title:              Max Length
          Type:               integer
        Raw:
          Default:      false
          Description:  Get the actual HTML content if the requested page, without simplification.
          Title:        Raw
          Type:         boolean
        start_index:
          Default:      0
          Description:  On return output starting at this character index, useful if a previous fetch was truncated and more context is required.
          Minimum:      0
          Title:        Start Index
          Type:         integer
        URL:
          Description:  URL to fetch
          Format:       uri
          Min Length:   1
          Title:        Url
          Type:         string
      Required:
        url
      Type:  object
    Name:    fetch
Events:
  Type    Reason     Age                  From                  Message
  ----    ------     ----                 ----                  -------
  Normal  Connected  3m14s (x8 over 63m)  mcpserver-controller  MCP server connected successfully
```

Then we can update our agent in-place to give it access to the fetch tool:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kubechain.humanlayer.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: my-assistant
spec:
  llmRef:
    name: gpt-4o
  system: |
    You are a helpful assistant. Your job is to help the user with their tasks.
  mcpServers:
    - name: fetch
EOF
```

```mermaid
graph RL
    Agent
    LLM
    Secret

    LLMRef --> LLM
    Credentials --> Secret


    subgraph LLM
      Provider
      Credentials
      ModelParameters
    end

    subgraph Agent
      LLMRef
      SystemPrompt
      MCPServers
    end

    subgraph MCPServer
      fetch[fetch server]
    end

    MCPServers --> MCPServer
```

Let's make a new task that uses the fetch tool. In this case, we'll use https://swapi.dev, a public API for Star Wars data.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kubechain.humanlayer.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: fetch-task
spec:
  agentRef:
    name: my-assistant
  userMessage: "what is the data at https://swapi.dev/api/people/1? "
EOF
```

You should see some events in the output of

```
kubectl get events --field-selector "involvedObject.kind=Task```

```

That's it! Go add your favorite MCPs and start running durable agents in Kubernetes!

### Incorporating Human Approval

For certain classes of MCP tools, you may want to incorporate human approval into an agent's workflow.

KubeChain supports this via [HumanLayer's](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer) [contact channels](https://www.humanlayer.dev/docs/channels/introduction)
to request human approval and input across Slack, email, and more.

**Note**: Directly approving tool calls with `kubectl` or a `kubechain` CLI is planned but not yet supported.

**Note**: We recommend running through the above examples first prior exploring this section. Several Kubernetes resources created in that section will be assumed to exist. If you'd like to see a full running version of the Kubernetes configuration used in this section, check out [kubechain_v1alpha_contactchannel_with_approval.yaml](./config/samples/kubechain_v1alpha_contactchannel_with_approval.yaml)

You'll need a HumanLayer API key to get started:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic humanlayer --from-literal=HUMANLAYER_API_KEY=$HUMANLAYER_API_KEY
```

Next, create a ContactChannel resource. In this example, we'll use an email contact channel (be sure to swap the `approver@example.com` address for a real target email address):

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kubechain.humanlayer.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ContactChannel
metadata:
  name: approval-channel 
spec:
  type: email # Replace with "slack" if using Slack
  apiKeyFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: humanlayer
      key: HUMANLAYER_API_KEY
  email:
    address: "approver@example.com" # Replace with actual target email address
    subject: "Approval Request from Kubechain"
    contextAboutUser: "Primary approver for web fetch operations"
EOF
```

Now, let's update our MCP server from the earlier example so that it references our contact channel.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kubechain.humanlayer.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: fetch
spec:
  transport: "stdio"
  command: "uvx"
  args: ["mcp-server-fetch"]
  # When an approvalContactChannel is specified, 
  # all tools on this MCP server will wait for human approval prior executing.
  approvalContactChannel:
    name: approval-channel 
EOF
```

Be sure you have an agent that references the above `MCPServer` by running `kubectl describe agent` or create a fresh `agent` with:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kubechain.humanlayer.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: agent-with-fetch
spec:
  llmRef:
    name: gpt-4o
  system: |
    You are a helpful assistant. Your job is to help the user with their tasks.
  mcpServers:
    - name: fetch
EOF
```

The fun part: Create a new task that uses the `fetch` tool to test the human approval workflow.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kubechain.humanlayer.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: approved-fetch-task
spec:
  agentRef:
    name: agent-with-fetch 
  message: "Write me a haiku about the character found at https://swapi.dev/api/people/2?"
EOF
```

Once this hits the tool call, we can check out the tool calls to see the human approval workflow in action:

```
kubectl get taskruntoolcall
```

```
$ kubectl get taskruntoolcall                                                              
NAME                          PHASE     TASKRUN                 TOOL
approved-fetch-task-1-tc-01   Pending   approved-fetch-task-1   fetch__fetch
```

and we run `describe` against the tool call to see that its waiting for human approval:


```
kubectl describe taskruntoolcall approved-fetch-task-1-tc-01  
```

```

```

Note as well, at this point our `taskrun` has not completed. If we run `kubectl get taskrun approved-fetch-task-1` no `OUTPUT` has yet been returned.

Go ahead and approve the email you should have received via HumanLayer requesting approval to run our `fetch` tool. After a few seconds, running `kubectl get taskruntoolcall approved-fetch-task-1-tc-01` should show our tool has been called. Additionally, if we run `kubectl describe taskrun approved-fetch-task-1`, we should see the following (truncated a bit for brevity):

### Using other Language Models

So far we've been using the `gpt-4o` model from OpenAI. KubeChain also supports using other language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex, and more.


Let's create a new LLM and Agent that uses the `claude-3-5-sonnet` model from Anthropic.

#### Create a secret

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl create secret generic anthropic --from-literal=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

#### Create an LLM

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kubechain.humanlayer.dev/v1alpha1
kind: LLM
metadata:
  name: claude-3-5-sonnet
spec:
  provider: anthropic
  model: claude-3-5-sonnet
EOF
```

fetch the LLM to verify it was created:

```
kubectl get llm claude-3-5-sonnet
```

```
#TODO paste output
```


**Exercise for the reader**: create a new Agent that uses the `claude-3-5-sonnet` model and our MCP server, and assign it a task!



### Cleaning Up

Remove our agent, task and related resources:

```
kubectl delete taskruntoolcall --all
kubectl delete taskrun --all
kubectl delete task --all
kubectl delete agent --all
kubectl delete mcpserver --all
kubectl delete llm --all
```

Remove the OpenAI secret:

```
kubectl delete secret openai
kubectl delete secret anthropic
kubectl delete secret humanlayer
```

Remove the operator, resources and custom resource definitions:

```
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humanlayer/smallchain/refs/heads/main/kubechain/config/release/latest.yaml
```

If you made a kind cluster, you can delete it with:

```
kind delete cluster
```

## Key Features

- **Kubernetes-Native Architecture**: KubeChain is built as a Kubernetes operator, using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to define and manage LLMs, Agents, Tools, Tasks, and TaskRuns.

- **Durable Agent Execution**: KubeChain implements something like async/await at the infrastructure layer, checkpointing a conversation chain whenever a tool call or agent delegation occurs, with the ability to resume from that checkpoint when the operation completes.

- **Dynamic Workflow Planning**: Allows agents to reprioritize and replan their workflows mid-execution.

- **Observable Control Loop Architecture**: KubeChain uses a simple, observable control loop architecture that allows for easy debugging and observability into agent execution.

- **Scalable**: Leverages Kubernetes for scalability and resilience. If you have k8s / etcd, you can run reliable distributed async agents.

- **Human Approvals and Input**: Support for durable task execution across long-running function calls means a simple tool-based interface to allow an agent to ask a human for input or wait for an approval.

## Design Principles

- **Simplicity**: Leverages the unique property of AI applications where the entire "call stack" can be expressed as the rolling context window accumulated through interactions and tool calls. No separate execution state.

- **Clarity**: Easy to understand what's happening and what the framework is doing with your prompts.

- **Control**: Ability to customize every aspect of agent behavior without framework limitations.

- **Modularity**: Composed of small control loops with limited scope that each progress the state of the world.

- **Durability**: Resilient to failures as a distributed system.

- **Extensibility**: Because agents are YAML, it's easy to build and share agents, tools, and tasks.
